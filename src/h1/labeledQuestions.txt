christians: do you think that christians can be indwelled by a demon xques i didn"t think so til i found this last night xperi please read if you have ever battled spiritual warfare xexcl can a christian have a demon xques when i first became involved in exorcisms xcomm i assumed that a christian was immune from the torment of demons xperi i based that assumption on the influence of other christian leaders who convinced me of this xperi i had perfected the logic explaining my position: the holy spirit and an evil spirit can"t dwell in the same vessel xperi light and darkness cannot co-exist xperi those who cast demons out of christians are making excuses for sin problems xperi i had given messages to large audiences xcomm boldly declaring that the very idea of a christian having a demon was heresy xperi i insisted that christians claiming to have demons were making excuses for problems of carnality or personal lack of discipline; they were avoiding the tough part of growing in grace and maturing in a deeper understanding of scripture xperi when i began searching the word of god more diligently about the matter of demons influencing christians xcomm i discovered that the issue wasn"t as conclusive as i had thought xperi gradually i understood that my error was based on a narrow understanding of demonic phenomena xcomm and a predetermined reading of scripture xperi in my honest moments of contemplation xcomm i realized that those pastors and bible teachers who had repeatedly reinforced the christians can"t have a demon outlook had very little practical experience with the phenomenon xperi i concluded that xcomm while doctrine is not based on experience xcomm the lack of experiential testimony about such a crucial area of spiritual deliverance was a glaring weakness xperi as i began to discuss the subject with others xcomm i learned that theological sentiments are often based on extreme examples xperi almost everyone opposed to the idea of christians having a demon could relate one or more horrific stories about exorcism sessions in which christians were encouraged to think of their spiritual failures as having a demonic root xperi they were then told to vomit up demons of everything from morning sickness to nasal congestion-seriously xexcl i had witnessed some of these deliverance sessions xperi highly manipulative evangelists preyed on distraught and gullible people who were looking for a quick solution to their spiritual and physical misery xperi i have since learned the simple truth that when you belong to god xcomm what satan cannot invade is your spirit xperi the moment a person is born into the kingdom of god by faith in christ ( eph xperi 2:8-9 ) xcomm the spirit is eternally reborn and belongs to god xperi jesus declared in john 10:28 that no one has the power to snatch us out of god"s hand xperi however xcomm man is a tripartite being ( 1 thessalonians 5:23 ) xcomm and there are aspects of the human condition that satan can afflict xperi while he is prohibited from touching the spirit of god"s saints xcomm nothing prevents him from tormenting the body and soul-if the disobedient conduct of a christian allows him to do so xperi much confusion about this issue exists because of the use of the word possession xperi the term doesn"t appear in the original greek language of the new testament xperi bible scholars say those who translated the king james edition added this word in order to classify varying degrees of demonic control xperi more correctly xcomm the word translated possession should simply be rendered demonized xcomm that is xcomm under the influence of a demon xperi attempting to be verbally precise about such a supernatural phenomenon is pointless xperi you can"t take something enshrouded in a mystical context and reduce it to a paradigm of human language xperi that"s why we must cautiously use terms associated with demons xperi by possession i mean that the spirit is internalized and claims certain legal rights to invade the person"s body xperi demonic possession never means a christian"s regenerated spirit has been invaded or that the demon owns the human being xperi it means that his or her soul or body is influenced by a demon xperi the demon can manifest through the host"s faculties-that is xcomm see with the eyes xcomm speak through the vocal cords xcomm and even subject the person to a trance state of mental oblivion xperi deliverance comes when the demon inside is cast outside xperi what about those instances in which a demon manifests in a christian xques in most cases the demon entered before the believer"s conversion to christianity xcomm and the evil spirit continued to control some part of the person"s life because the specific occult sin was never renounced xperi the demon claims squatter"s rights xperi the metaphor of what happens when territory is conquered in a war applies here xperi even though the conflict may be officially ended xcomm enemy snipers refuse to surrender xcomm so they must be hunted down xperi their right to remain may be technically voided since the territory is under new control xcomm but that doesn"t mean they leave automatically or give up easily xperi an offense must be mounted to enforce the terms of victory xperi the exorcist must diligently pursue every avenue of deliverance to be certain that every demonic influence has been conquered xperi can demons physically afflict a christian xques to answer the question of whether a christian can be physically afflicted xcomm we must first explore the means by which demons influence christians xperi do christians sin xques of course xexcl first john 1:8-9 says we do xperi we cannot continue to abide in sin because of the indwelling nature of christ xperi note xcomm however xcomm that in ephesians 4:23 christians are admonished to be renewed in the spirit of your mind xperi if the mind of the christian needs renewal xcomm then it stands to reason that when our minds are not renewed xcomm they may be xcomm to some degree xcomm under the control of the ungodly forces xperi present your bodies a living sacrifice xcomm we read in romans 12:1 xperi this means our bodies may not be completely sacrificed to god xcomm and could therefore be influenced by satan xperi the lack of spirituality in the life of a christian doesn"t necessarily mean he or she is possessed xperi but it does mean that some part of the christian"s nature is open to evil forces xperi in luke 13:16 xcomm christ cast a demon out of a "daughter of abraham" xperi it"s true she wasn"t living under the covenant of grace this side of the cross xcomm but as an old testament devotee to god xcomm she was spiritually protected by the best that god could offer that side of calvary xperi yet a spirit of physical infirmity demonized her xperi in fact xcomm the first demon that jesus cast out came from an apparently devout jew in the synagogue on the sabbath xperi christ"s first exorcism was in a church xexcl the man in luke 4:33-35 was certainly possessed because the demon spoke through his body xperi christ told the unclean spirit to come out of him ( verse 35 ) xperi can satan control a christian"s thoughts and words xques let me explain how satan can also control the thoughts and speech of a christian xperi in matthew xcomm chapter 16 xcomm jesus had just concluded his explanation to his disciples on the true nature of his earthly mission-that he must suffer and die ( verse 21 ) xperi peter immediately spoke up in an effort to dissuade christ from going to the cross: far be it from you xcomm lord; this shall not happen to you xexcl ( verse 22 ) xperi the response of christ was abrupt and stern xperi get behind me xcomm satan xexcl jesus said to peter ( verse 23 ) xperi i"m not suggesting that peter was demon possessed xperi i am proposing that peter xcomm while standing in the presence of christ xcomm was sufficiently influenced that he literally spoke the words satan wanted him to say xperi even more astounding is the fact that earlier in verse 16 of that chapter xcomm peter had given the confessional statement of faith on which christ said he would build his church xexcl in acts chapter 5 xcomm ananias and sapphira xcomm members of the early church xcomm lied to the apostle peter xperi they had sold some possessions to give to the church xcomm and then had second thoughts and conspired to keep back a portion for themselves xperi when peter asked them what amount they had received for the sale xcomm ananias and sapphira lied xperi what was the source of that lie xques the apostle peter said xcomm satan filled your heart to lie to the holy spirit ( verse 3 ) xperi in judgment xcomm god struck them dead xperi if we accept the assumption that ananias and sapphira experienced the new birth in christ xcomm then how can we explain away the fact that their hearts were filled by satan to such an extent that they were capable of committing a sin worthy of such abrupt and severe divine judgment xques satan can xcomm in some instances xcomm take over a christian"s mind and speak through his lips xperi demons are in certain instances able to place christians in a trance state so that the unclean spirit controls psychomotor functions and conscious mental processes xperi i have dealt with scores of cases with people who were undeniably followers of christ and yet demons spoke through them and even violently attacked me xperi it is disingenuous to suggest that they somehow lost their salvation long enough to let a demon in and then thereafter resumed their christian walk xperi if satan can control our speech when we are disobedient and fill our hearts with evil when we are rebellious xcomm he may be able to do a lot more to christians than we would like to admit xperi what scriptural lessons can we learn from this startling information xques a christian can be born again and have spiritual victory over the original adamic sin that eternally separates mankind from god and still have besetting sins ( hebrews 12:1 ) xperi uncontrolled thoughts xcomm resentment xcomm anger xcomm and bitterness are some examples xperi salvation must not be confused with sanctification xperi the holy spirit"s continuing work of grace is a progressive act of god"s desire to draw us closer to him xperi those who xcomm yet saved xcomm resist this scriptural plea ( 1 thessalonians 4:3 ) may find they have harbored demonic pockets of activity from their pre-conversion lives xperi this message needs a greater emphasis in our churches so that we may set free any of our brothers and sisters in christ who are suffering the hangover of satan"s influence from their former lives of sin xperi as kindly as i can say it xcomm those who underestimate what christians can suffer at the hand of satan are doing a disservice to the body of christ xperi they are consigning sincere christians to a life of continued demonic influence and causing needless suffering in the lives of those whom the lord wants to set free xperi let no one misunderstand me xperi a christian cannot be demonized if by possession you mean ownership xperi the child of god is owned by the lord xperi but i will testify that a christian can be severely influenced by demons and even be inhabited by them xperi i will also do all that i can in jesus" name to see that those who are heirs of god and joint heirs with christ ( romans 8:17 ) will experience the hope of freedom from demonic bondage
